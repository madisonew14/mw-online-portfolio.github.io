      <h2>2020 Apprenti Website Refresh</h2>
     <h3>The Client</h3>
     <p>Based in Seattle, WA, Apprenti Careers is a national tech apprenticeship program that aims to bridge the diversity gap in today’s tech industry.</p>
     
     <h3>The Problem</h3>
     <p>Up until 2020, Apprenti’s website content and structure were designed to target job seekers- those who are looking to apply to the Apprenti apprenticeship program. 
      Apprenti’s old site included more CTA’s pointing users to apply pages, featured content geared towards answering application questions, and overall content was focused on attracting apprenticeship applicants.</p>
     
     <p>However, with a recent shift in business focuses, the organization’s goal was to now target what they call ‘hiring partners’. Hiring partners are tech companies around the country who look to hire Apprenti’s apprentices, and would eventually hire them as permanent employees. 
      The problem was that the old Apprenti site was not geared toward generating more hiring partner leads and its content did not target hiring partner companies.<p> 
     <p>The business development team at Apprenti asked for the new site to:</p>
     <ul id="ApprentiList">
      <li>Provide more CTA’s on how to become a Apprenti Hiring Partner</li>
      <li>Include new website copy that provides more information on the apprenticeship program through the lens of a potential hiring partner (ie. how the hiring process works with Apprenti, how it benefits the company, why they should hire Apprenti apprentices, and something that illustrates the</li>
      <li>Provide more CTA’s on how to become a Apprenti Hiring Partner</li>
      <li>Continue to be a resource for those looking to become apprentices by providing information on the application process and the apprenticeship program.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>The Process</h3>
     <h4>Phase 1: Building the Team</h4>
     <h4>Phase 2: Generating/collecting Content, Building Early Sitemap</h4>
     <h4>Phase 3: Building Wireframes and other Visual Elements</h4>



     
     <h3>The Result</h3>
